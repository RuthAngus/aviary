\subsection{A Gaussian process gyrochronology relation}
\label{sec:gp_model}

To calibrate a new gyrochronology relation, we fit a Gaussian process-based
model to the kinematic ages described above, as well as a set of field and
cluster benchmark stars.
These benchmark stars are stars with precise rotation periods measured from
Kepler/K2 light curves, and well-determined ages from cluster isochrone
fitting or asteroseismology.
