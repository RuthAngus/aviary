\subsection{Calibrating a new gyrochronology relation}
\label{sec:calibration}

To calibrate a new gyrochronology relation, we fit a Gaussian process model to
the kinematic ages described above, as well as a number of stars in open
clusters.
These benchmark stars have precise rotation periods measured from Kepler/K2
light curves, and well-determined ages from cluster-based isochrone fitting.
